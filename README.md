# A Simple Builder Pattern Example Inspired by Metal Gear Solid V
This project demonstrates the Builder design pattern through a simplified recreation of the prep mission screen from Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. Built with Go, it serves as a clear and practical illustration of how to construct complex objects step-by-step using a fluent and modular approach.
